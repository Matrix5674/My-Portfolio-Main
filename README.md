# Welcome to My Portfolio! :wave:

#### This is where I showcase my achievements ðŸ’¯, interests :soccer:, and highlights ðŸ’¡ in regards to my career becoming a Software Developer.

Hey! :wave: My name is Soham. I am a Sophomore at Fremont High School looking to pursue a career in Artificial Intelligence and Programming. This project is a huge highlight ðŸ’¡ that on its own showcases my Web Development capabilities.
